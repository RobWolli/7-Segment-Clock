# 7-Segment-Clock

Based on Leon van den Beukel's [project] (https://github.com/leonvandenbeukel/7-Segment-Digital-Clock-V2) - I have extended the clock to display also seconds.
In my office, however, I also wanted the clock to display the seconds, so I expanded the solution in terms of both hardware and software as I had imagined.

Components used:

    - ESP8266 WeMos Mini D1 1x
    - DS3231 RTC 1x
    - Micro USB breakout board 1x
    - Micro USB cable 1x
    - 5V 2.5A power supply 1x
    - WS2812B LED Strip 60 LED's per meter 2x

I did not print the housings, but created them with the CNC milling machine. I only drew the front covers of the individual segments myself with FeeCad and printed them in 3D.
